# TODO

As the project isn't big enough to warrant a proper roadmap, this is
a list of potential features/bugfixes.

## Features

- [ ] Other (non-openai) models
- [ ] Copying files instead of moving them
- [ ] Renaming files in place (instead of having an input AND output dir)
- [ ] Unit tests galore
- [ ] AI testing (evalite?)
- [ ] e2e testing
- [ ] DB for movie/show names
- [ ] More config options via envvars
  - [ ] OpenAI model ENVVAR (eg. choose between gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4)
- [ ] Custom extras dir name

## Bugfixes

- [ ] Only create extras dir if there are more than 1 file
